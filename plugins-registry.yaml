# FORGE External Plugin Registry — REFERENCE COPY ONLY
#
# The active bundled registry is at:
#   packages/forge-cli/src/forge_cli/data/plugins-registry.yaml
#
# This root copy is no longer loaded by default. Edit the bundled copy instead.
# It can still be used for local overrides by setting:
#   FORGE_PLUGIN_REGISTRY=/path/to/this/file forge plugin list
#
# Format:
#   plugin-name:
#     package: "python-package-name"

#     ref: "v1.0.0"  # Optional: git tag, branch, or commit hash
#     description: "Plugin description"
#     plugin_type: "native" or "wrapper"
#     tags: [tag1, tag2]
#     private: true/false
#     system_deps:  # Optional: non-Python binaries installed by `forge plugin install`

#
# Plugin Types:
#   - native: External project implements ToolPlugin directly
#   - wrapper: FORGE provides adapter that wraps external tool (zero changes to external tool)
#
# Authentication:
#   - HTTPS URLs use GitHub token from git config
#   - SSH URLs use SSH keys (~/.ssh/id_*)
#   - Same authentication as `git clone` - no additional setup needed
