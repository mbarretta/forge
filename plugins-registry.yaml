# FORGE External Plugin Registry
#
# This registry lists external plugins that can be installed via `forge plugin install`.
# External plugins are installed from git repositories and work alongside built-in plugins.
#
# Format:
#   plugin-name:
#     package: "python-package-name"
#     source: "git+https://github.com/org/repo.git"  or  "git+ssh://git@github.com/org/repo.git"
#     ref: "v1.0.0"  # Optional: git tag, branch, or commit hash
#     description: "Plugin description"
#     plugin_type: "native" or "wrapper"
#     tags: [tag1, tag2]
#     private: true/false
#     system_deps:  # Optional: non-Python binaries installed by `forge plugin install`
#       - manager: "go"   # Supported: "go" | "npm"
#         package: "github.com/org/tool@v1.2.3"  # Verbatim install argument
#         binary: "tool"  # Binary name checked via shutil.which (skipped if already present)
#
# Plugin Types:
#   - native: External project implements ToolPlugin directly
#   - wrapper: FORGE provides adapter that wraps external tool (zero changes to external tool)
#
# Authentication:
#   - HTTPS URLs use GitHub token from git config
#   - SSH URLs use SSH keys (~/.ssh/id_*)
#   - Same authentication as `git clone` - no additional setup needed
