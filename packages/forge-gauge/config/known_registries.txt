# Known Registries Configuration
#
# List registries that you have already authenticated to (one per line).
# These registries will skip upstream discovery since images can be pulled directly.
#
# Examples:
#   artifactory.mycompany.com
#   123456789.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
#   myregistry.azurecr.io
#
# Note: Public registries (docker.io, gcr.io, ghcr.io, quay.io, etc.) and
# Iron Bank (registry1.dso.mil) are handled automatically.
#
# Lines starting with # are comments and will be ignored.
# Empty lines are also ignored.
